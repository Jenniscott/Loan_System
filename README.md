# Loan_System Smart Contract
This is a Loan System Smart Contract implemented in Solidity, featuring two smart contracts: the UserWallet and LoanSystem.

The UserWallet creates user accounts, stores users' names and balances, allows users to deposit, and get their balances.

The LoanSystem allows users to apply for a loan. If they have at least 1 Ether, their loan is accepted; if not, it is rejected.
